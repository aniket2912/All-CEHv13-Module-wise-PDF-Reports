# Social Engineering

## 📌 Introduction
**Social Engineering** is the art of manipulating people into revealing confidential information, performing actions, or granting access to systems without realizing the security risks involved.  
Instead of directly attacking systems, attackers exploit **human psychology** to bypass security measures.

---

## 🎯 Objectives of Social Engineering
- Understand how attackers use deception to exploit human behavior.
- Identify common social engineering techniques.
- Learn how to detect and prevent such attacks.
- Perform controlled simulations for awareness training.

## ⚙️ Common Types of Social Engineering Attacks
1. **Phishing**
   - Fake emails or websites trick users into giving credentials.
2. **Spear Phishing**
   - Targeted phishing attack on a specific person or organization.
3. **Vishing**
   - Voice phishing using phone calls.
4. **Smishing**
   - SMS-based phishing attacks.
5. **Pretexting**
   - Fabricating a scenario to get personal information.
6. **Baiting**
   - Offering something attractive (e.g., free USB drive) to trick users.
7. **Tailgating / Piggybacking**
   - Following authorized personnel into restricted areas.
8. **Quid Pro Quo**
   - Offering a service in exchange for confidential information.

## 🔍 Methodology
1. **Information Gathering** – Research the target via OSINT, social media, and public records.
2. **Pretext Development** – Create a believable scenario or disguise.
3. **Attack Execution** – Deliver phishing emails, phone calls, or in-person requests.
4. **Exploitation** – Gain access to information, credentials, or systems.
5. **Exit & Cover Tracks** – Leave no trace of the interaction.
6. **Analysis & Reporting** – Document results for security awareness.

## 🧪 Hands-on Labs
### **Lab 1: Simulated Phishing Email Campaign**
- Create a phishing email template.
- Send to a test group and track click rates.

### **Lab 2: USB Drop Baiting**
- Load a harmless file onto USB drives and drop them in a controlled environment.
- Measure how many are plugged in.

### **Lab 3: Vishing Simulation**
- Call users pretending to be IT support.
- Request harmless test information for awareness training.

---

## 🛡️ Prevention & Mitigation
- Conduct **regular security awareness training** for employees.
- Implement **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.
- Use **email filtering** to block phishing attempts.
- Verify identities before sharing sensitive information.
- Limit public exposure of employee details.
- Encourage **reporting of suspicious activity**.

## 🧰 Tools for Social Engineering Simulations
- **SET (Social-Engineer Toolkit)** – Phishing and credential harvesting simulations.
- **Gophish** – Phishing framework for awareness training.
- **King Phisher** – Phishing campaign management.
- **OSINT Tools** – Maltego, Recon-ng, theHarvester for reconnaissance.

## 📄 Reporting & Documentation
When documenting social engineering tests:
- Describe the attack type and objectives.
- Provide examples of messages, calls, or scenarios used.
- Include success metrics (e.g., click-through rate).
- Suggest training and security improvements.
