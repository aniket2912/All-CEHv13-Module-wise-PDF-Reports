# DoS & DDoS Attacks

## üìå Introduction
**Denial of Service (DoS)** and **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** are cyberattacks designed to make a network service, server, or application unavailable to its intended users.  
- **DoS Attack**: A single system sends a flood of requests to overload the target.  
- **DDoS Attack**: Multiple compromised systems (botnet) send traffic simultaneously to exhaust resources.

## üéØ Objectives of DoS/DDoS Attacks
- Understand how DoS and DDoS attacks work.
- Learn the types and techniques used by attackers.
- Identify vulnerabilities that allow these attacks.
- Explore detection and prevention methods.
- Perform controlled lab simulations for learning.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Types of DoS/DDoS Attacks
1. **Volume-Based Attacks**
   - UDP Flood
   - ICMP Flood (Ping Flood)
   - Amplification Attacks (DNS, NTP, SNMP)
2. **Protocol Attacks**
   - SYN Flood
   - Smurf Attack
   - Ping of Death
3. **Application Layer Attacks**
   - HTTP Flood
   - Slowloris
   - RUDY (R U Dead Yet?)

## üîç Methodology
1. **Reconnaissance** ‚Äì Identify target IP/Domain.
2. **Resource Enumeration** ‚Äì Determine bandwidth, services, and open ports.
3. **Attack Execution** ‚Äì Use single or distributed sources.
4. **Impact Assessment** ‚Äì Observe downtime and resource usage.
5. **Cleanup & Analysis** ‚Äì Stop attack and analyze logs.

## üß™ Hands-on Labs
### **Lab 1: Perform a SYN Flood Attack (Hping3)**
- Use `hping3` to send rapid TCP SYN requests.
- Monitor server response and CPU usage.

### **Lab 2: UDP Flood Simulation**
- Generate high UDP traffic to a target port.
- Capture traffic with Wireshark.

### **Lab 3: HTTP Flood with Slowloris**
- Use Slowloris to exhaust web server connections.

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention & Mitigation
- Use **Firewalls & Intrusion Prevention Systems** to block malicious IPs.
- Enable **Rate Limiting & Traffic Shaping**.
- Deploy **DDoS Protection Services** (Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS Shield).
- Implement **Redundant Infrastructure** (Load Balancers, CDNs).
- Keep **OS and Applications Updated**.

## üß∞ Tools for DoS/DDoS Testing
- **Hping3** ‚Äì Network packet generator.
- **LOIC/HOIC** ‚Äì HTTP/UDP/TCP flooding tools.
- **Slowloris** ‚Äì Application layer DoS.
- **Metasploit Auxiliary Modules** ‚Äì DoS simulations.
- **Wireshark** ‚Äì Monitoring and analysis.

## üìÑ Reporting & Documentation
When documenting a DoS/DDoS test:
- Include target details (with permission).
- Describe attack type and tools used.
- Note impact metrics (CPU, memory, uptime).
- Recommend mitigation strategies.
