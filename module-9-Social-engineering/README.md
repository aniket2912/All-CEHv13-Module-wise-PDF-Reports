üîê What is Social Engineering?
Social Engineering is the art of manipulating people so they give up confidential information. It exploits human psychology rather than technical hacking techniques to gain access to systems, networks, or physical locations, or for financial gain.

üéØ Primary Goal ---  The main objective is to trick individuals into revealing sensitive data like:
     1) Passwords
     2) Bank information
     3) Access credentials
     4) Personal data

üß† Core Concepts

      1. Psychological Manipulation
           Attackers exploit:
              1) Trust
              2) Fear
              3) Greed
              4) Helpfulness
              5) Curiosity

       2. Pretexting --- Attacker fabricates a scenario to obtain information. For example, pretending to be IT support to ask for login credentials.

       3. Impersonation --- Attacker assumes a trusted identity (e.g., a boss, technician, law enforcement).

üõ†Ô∏è Types of Social Engineering Attacks
  
    1. Phishing
         a) Fake emails/websites to steal credentials.
         b) Often impersonate banks, companies, or services (like PayPal).

    2. Spear Phishing
         a) A targeted form of phishing.
         b) Personalized to a specific individual or organization.

    3. Whaling
         a) Targeting high-profile individuals (CEO, CFO, etc.).
         b) Goal: gain privileged access or steal sensitive data.

    4. Vishing (Voice Phishing)
         a) Phone call scams.
         b) Example: "Your account is locked. Tell us your OTP."

    5. Smishing (SMS Phishing)
         a) Attack via SMS messages.
         b) Example: ‚ÄúClick this link to win a free phone.‚Äù

    6. Baiting
         a) Leaving infected USBs in public places labeled ‚Äúconfidential‚Äù or ‚Äúsalary details.‚Äù

    7. Tailgating / Piggybacking
         a) Physically following an authorized person into a restricted area.
   
    8. Pretexting 
         a) Creating a believable lie to gain the victim‚Äôs trust and extract data.

    9. Quid Pro Quo
         a) Offering something (like a gift or service) in exchange for sensitive information.

üß™ Common Real-Life Examples
      
    a)Tech support scams
    b)Fake job interviews to collect personal data
    c)Impersonating HR to gather employee credentials
    d) Creating fake Wi-Fi hotspots in public areas

üìâ Impact of Social Engineering Attacks

    a) Identity theft
    b) Financial loss
    c) Unauthorized access to corporate systems
    d) Reputation damage
    e) Legal consequences for affected organizations

üîê How to Prevent Social Engineering

    1. Security Awareness Training
        a) Regular sessions to educate employees on recognizing and handling suspicious activities.

    2. Verify Identity
        a) Always verify unknown callers or emails.
        b) Avoid clicking unknown links or downloading files from untrusted sources.

    3. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
        a) Even if credentials are stolen, 2FA prevents access.

    4. Email Filtering
        a) Use spam filters and phishing detection tools.

    5. Physical Security
        a) Lock computers when not in use.
        b) Use ID cards for restricted area access.

    6. Report Suspicious Activity
        a) Foster a culture where employees report anything unusual.

üß™ Social Engineering in Penetration Testing (Ethical Hacking)
     
     As an ethical hacker or VAPT tester, you may simulate social engineering attacks (with permission) to:
     a) Test employee awareness
     b) Identify weak points
     c) Improve defense mechanisms

    Common ethical methods:
     a) Fake phishing emails
     b) Dropping USBs with keyloggers in employee areas
     c) Simulated vishing attempts
