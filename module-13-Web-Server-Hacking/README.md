# Web Server Hacking

## 📌 Introduction
Web servers are critical components of modern applications, responsible for hosting and delivering web content to users.  
However, vulnerabilities in their configuration, services, or applications can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or take control of the server.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand how web servers work.
- Learn about common vulnerabilities in web servers.
- Explore various attacks and their prevention methods.
- Perform hands-on penetration testing on web servers.

---

## 🛠 Methodology
1. **Information Gathering** – Identify server software, version, and configurations.
2. **Vulnerability Scanning** – Use tools to find security weaknesses.
3. **Exploitation** – Attempt to exploit discovered vulnerabilities.
4. **Post-Exploitation** – Maintain access or escalate privileges.
5. **Reporting** – Document vulnerabilities and recommendations.

## 🔍 Common Web Server Vulnerabilities
- Default configurations
- Directory traversal
- Misconfigured permissions
- Outdated server software
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- SQL Injection
- WebDAV vulnerabilities

---

## 📡 Tools Used
- **Nmap** – Port scanning & service detection
- **Nikto** – Web server vulnerability scanning
- **Burp Suite** – Manual and automated testing
- **OWASP ZAP** – Web application security testing
- **Metasploit Framework** – Exploitation

## ⚡ Practical Labs

### Lab 1 – Information Gathering on a Web Server
- Performed Nmap scan to identify open ports and services.
- Detected web server software and version.

### Lab 2 – Vulnerability Scanning with Nikto
- Scanned the target web server for misconfigurations and known vulnerabilities.
- Identified sensitive directories and outdated software.

### Lab 3 – Exploiting a Vulnerable Web Server
- Used Metasploit to exploit a known vulnerability.
- Gained limited shell access on the server.

### Lab 4 – Manual Testing with Burp Suite
- Intercepted HTTP requests.
- Manipulated parameters to test for vulnerabilities.

### Lab 5 – Securing the Web Server
- Disabled unused services.
- Applied latest security patches.
- Restricted directory access.

---

## 🛡 Prevention & Best Practices
- Regularly update web server software.
- Remove default and sample files.
- Disable directory listing.
- Enforce strong authentication.
- Use HTTPS for secure communication.
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity.

---

## 📄 Deliverables
- List of identified vulnerabilities.
- Screenshots of exploit attempts.
- Security recommendations for remediation.
