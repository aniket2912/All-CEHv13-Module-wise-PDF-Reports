ðŸ¦  Malware Analysis: 
ðŸ”¸ 1. What is Malware Analysis?
Malware Analysis is the process of studying malicious software to understand its behavior, origin, purpose, and potential impact. The goal is to:

i) Identify how it works.

ii) Determine Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).

iii) Develop detection and mitigation strategies.

ðŸ”¸ 2. Types of Malware
Type	               Description
1) Virus --- Attaches to files and spreads when infected files are executed.
2) Worm ---	Spreads automatically across networks without user interaction.
3) Trojan ---	Disguises as legitimate software but has malicious code.
4) Ransomware ---	Encrypts data and demands payment.
5) Spyware ---	Collects user information without consent.
6) Rootkit ---	Hides malicious activity and provides persistent access.
7) Adware ---	Displays unwanted ads and tracks behavior.
8) Keylogger ---	Records keystrokes to steal credentials.

ðŸ”¸ 3. Goals of Malware Analysis
i) Identify infection vectors.

ii) Understand persistence mechanisms.

iii) Detect command-and-control (C2) communication.

iv) Extract IOCs (hashes, IP addresses, domains).

v) Develop signatures for AV/IDS.

ðŸ”¸ 4. Types of Malware Analysis
1. Static Analysis
Examines malware without executing it.

Tools:
1) Strings (extracts readable text)

2) PEiD, Detect It Easy (DIE) (check file type & packers)

3) IDA Pro, Ghidra, Radare2 (disassembly)

4) VirusTotal (hash check & AV detection)

2. Dynamic Analysis
Runs malware in an isolated environment to observe behavior.

Tools:
1) Cuckoo Sandbox

2) Any.Run

3) Procmon & Process Explorer (process monitoring)

4) Wireshark (network traffic capture)

3. Hybrid Analysis
Combines static & dynamic methods for deeper insights.
Tools:
1) Hybrid-Analysis.com

2) Joe Sandbox

3) Intezer Analyze

4. Memory Analysis
Examines malware artifacts in system memory.

Tools:
1) Volatility

2) Rekall

3) Redline

ðŸ”¸ 5. Malware Analysis Workflow
1) Preparation -- Set up an isolated lab (VMWare, VirtualBox, REMnux, FLARE VM).

2) Initial Triage -- i) Identify file type (PE, ELF, script, macro). ii) Calculate hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256).

3) Static Analysis -- Extract strings, check imports/exports, identify packers.

4) Dynamic Analysis -- Monitor process creation, registry changes, network connections.

5) Memory Forensics -- Analyze RAM dumps for injected code and artifacts.

6) eporting -- Document IOCs, behavior, and recommended remediation.

ðŸ”¸ 6. Common Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
1) File Hashes (MD5/SHA256)
2) Registry Keys modified or created
3) IP Addresses contacted
4) Domain Names used for C2
5) File Paths for dropped files
6) Persistence Mechanisms (scheduled tasks, startup entries)

ðŸ”¸ 7. Popular Malware Analysis Tools
Category	           Tools
1) Static ---	Strings, PEiD, Detect It Easy, IDA Pro, Ghidra
2) Dynamic ---	Cuckoo Sandbox, Any.Run, Procmon, Process Explorer
3) Hybrid ---	Hybrid-Analysis, Joe Sandbox
4) Memory ---	Volatility, Rekall, Redline
5) Network ---	Wireshark, Fiddler

ðŸ”¸ 8. Best Practices
1) Always analyze in an isolated lab (air-gapped VM).

2) Take snapshots before running malware.

3) Use multiple tools to cross-check results.

4) Document everything for reporting and legal purposes.
