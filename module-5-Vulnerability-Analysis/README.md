üîç Vulnerability Analysis Overview
Vulnerability Analysis is the process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing (or ranking) vulnerabilities in a system, application, network, or device. It helps organizations uncover weaknesses before attackers exploit them.

üìå Key Stages:
Information Gathering

Scanning & Enumeration

Vulnerability Detection

Analysis & Verification

Reporting & Remediation Planning
