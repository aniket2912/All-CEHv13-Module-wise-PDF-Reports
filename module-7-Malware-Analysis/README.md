# Malware Analysis

## 📌 Introduction
**Malware Analysis** is the process of examining malicious software to understand its functionality, behavior, and potential impact.  
It helps cybersecurity professionals detect, contain, and remove threats, as well as develop stronger defenses.

---

## 🎯 Objectives of Malware Analysis
- Identify the type and behavior of malware.
- Understand how malware spreads and infects systems.
- Extract indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- Assist in developing detection signatures and security patches.
- Gather intelligence for incident response and forensics.

## ⚖️ Malware Analysis vs Malware Forensics
- **Malware Analysis** – Focuses on understanding how malware works and behaves (dynamic & static analysis).
- **Malware Forensics** – Focuses on collecting and preserving evidence for legal investigation after a malware incident.

---

## 🧪 Types of Malware Analysis
1. **Static Analysis**
   - Examining malware without executing it.
   - Checking file hashes, strings, and headers.
   - Reverse engineering with tools like IDA Pro and Ghidra.

2. **Dynamic Analysis**
   - Running malware in a controlled environment (sandbox).
   - Observing behavior, network calls, and file modifications.

3. **Memory Analysis**
   - Inspecting volatile memory to detect in-memory payloads.

---

## 📂 Types of Evidence in Malware Analysis
- Malicious binaries/executables.
- Suspicious scripts (JavaScript, PowerShell).
- Log files showing infection activity.
- Network traffic captures.
- Registry changes and system modifications.

---

## 🧰 Tools for Malware Analysis
- **PEiD** – Detects packers and compilers.
- **PEStudio** – Static analysis tool for Windows executables.
- **IDA Pro / Ghidra** – Disassembly and reverse engineering.
- **VirusTotal** – Online multi-antivirus scan.
- **Didier Stevens Suite** – PDF malware analysis.
- **Pdf-Streamer-Dumper** – PDF file inspection.
- **Wireshark** – Network traffic analysis.
