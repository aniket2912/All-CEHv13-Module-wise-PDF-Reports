# System Hacking

## üìå Introduction
**System Hacking** is the process of exploiting vulnerabilities in an operating system to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, steal information, or control system resources.  
It is a critical phase in penetration testing and ethical hacking to assess the security posture of target systems.

---

## üéØ Objectives of System Hacking
- Gain access to the target system.
- Escalate privileges for full administrative control.
- Execute malicious or testing payloads.
- Steal sensitive information (passwords, tokens, documents).
- Create persistence for long-term access.
- Cover tracks to avoid detection.

---

## üîë Phases of System Hacking
1. **Gaining Access**
   - Exploiting system vulnerabilities.
   - Using stolen credentials or brute force attacks.
   - Exploiting misconfigured services.

2. **Privilege Escalation**
   - Elevating privileges from a low-level user to administrator/root.
   - Exploiting weak permissions or kernel vulnerabilities.
   - Using UAC bypass techniques (Windows).

3. **Executing Applications**
   - Running malicious scripts, malware, or keyloggers.
   - Leveraging remote command execution (RCE).

4. **Maintaining Access**
   - Creating backdoors.
   - Modifying registry entries for persistence.
   - Adding new hidden admin accounts.

5. **Covering Tracks**
   - Clearing logs and removing evidence.
   - Using anti-forensic techniques.

## üß∞ Tools for System Hacking
- **Metasploit Framework** ‚Äì Exploitation and post-exploitation.
- **Mimikatz** ‚Äì Credential dumping and privilege escalation.
- **CrackMapExec** ‚Äì Remote code execution over SMB.
- **Netcat** ‚Äì Backdoor and remote shell.
- **PowerShell Empire** ‚Äì Post-exploitation framework.
- **Windows Credential Editor (WCE)** ‚Äì Dump and replay passwords.
- **ProcDump** ‚Äì Dumping process memory.
- **Keyloggers** ‚Äì Logging keystrokes for password theft.

## üß™ Practical Steps
### **Step 1: Gaining Access**
- Exploit vulnerabilities in SMB, RDP, or other services.
- Use phishing attacks to deliver payloads.
- Apply password guessing or brute force.

### **Step 2: Privilege Escalation**
- **Windows:** Use `whoami /priv` to check privileges.
- Use `getsystem` in Meterpreter for SYSTEM privileges.
- Run Local Exploit Suggester in Metasploit.
- Manual UAC bypass techniques.

### **Step 3: Executing Applications**
- Deploy a keylogger (`keyscan_start` in Meterpreter).
- Execute remote commands with `shell` or `execute` in Meterpreter.
- Drop and execute files.

### **Step 4: Maintaining Access**
- Create hidden accounts:  
  `net user backdoor pass123 /add`  
  `net localgroup administrators backdoor /add`
- Set reverse shell persistence in registry.

### **Step 5: Clearing Tracks**
- Clear Windows event logs:  
  `wevtutil cl System`  
  `wevtutil cl Security`
- Remove dropped payloads and scripts.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Attack Vectors
- Exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities.
- Weak or reused passwords.
- Misconfigured file and folder permissions.
- Default admin accounts with unchanged credentials.
- Weak service configurations.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Countermeasures
- Regular patching and updates.
- Enforce strong password policies.
- Disable unnecessary services and ports.
- Implement application whitelisting.
- Enable logging and continuous monitoring.
- Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools.

## üìÑ Reporting & Documentation
When documenting a System Hacking assessment:
- Provide exploited vulnerabilities and methods used.
- List compromised accounts and privilege levels.
- Include screenshots of exploitation and post-exploitation activities.
- Recommend remediation steps.
